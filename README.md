# Toy Language Interpreter

This is a Toy Language Interpreter developed in Java as part of an academic project. The interpreter allows for the execution of programs written in a simple toy programming language, featuring various statements, expressions, and data structures.

## Overview

The Toy Language Interpreter is designed to execute programs written in a simple toy programming language. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for program selection and monitoring the program's execution state. The interpreter supports various statements, expressions, and data structures, offering a comprehensive environment for programming and execution.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides an intuitive interface for selecting programs and monitoring their execution.
- **Execution Monitoring**: Displays the program's execution state, including PrgStates, HeapTable, Out, FileTable, SymTable, and ExeStack.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Allows running the program step-by-step using the "Run one step" button.
- **Type Checking**: Includes type checking functionality to ensure type safety of programs before execution.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Toy Language Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/toy-language-interpreter.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.
4. Run the main application to launch the GUI.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the GUI to select a program from the list and monitor its execution. Follow these steps:

1. Select a program from the list displayed in the Program Selection Window.
2. View the execution state in the Main Window, including PrgStates, HeapTable, Out, FileTable, SymTable, and ExeStack.
3. Click the "Run one step" button to execute one step of the program.
4. Monitor the changes in the displayed information after each step of execution.
